## Object Oriented Programming in Java - Coursera

This repository contain the work I have done with regard to the **Data structures: Measuring and Optimizing Performance** course in Coursera under the specialization, **Java Programming: Object-Oriented Design of Data Structures**. The project for this course consist of a text editor application along with a GUI which uses efficient data structures to spellcheck and other text manipulations. This project uses a wide range of data structures such as LinkedLists, Binary Search Trees, Tries, HashSets and HashMaps etc.
